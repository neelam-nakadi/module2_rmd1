This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure1, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot(pressure, main = "Pressure plot")
```

## Insert tables:
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars), caption = "Top 6 rows of cars dataset")
```

## Insert an equation
$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X $$
